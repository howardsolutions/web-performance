# Web Performance Notes

## 🥸 The First Problem - If the website is slow

👉 We are losing $$$$ because of less conversion, bad user experience
👉 It's mostly Frontend Responsibilities

## You're already doing things below to optimize the website

👉 Optimize Network Transfer <br />
👉 Working with HTTPS and HTTP2 <br />
👉 CSS as Appetizer<br />
👉 JavaScript<br />
👉 Optimizing Images<br />
👉 Defining Policy for HTTP Cache<br />
👉 Using Service Worker

🚨 `It turns out the time to Interatice on the website is still SLOW, as page load time goes from 1s to 10s, the probability of a mobile visitor to bound INCREASE BY 123%, we're losing client and money`

## 🥸 Not Bandwidth, The problem with browsing speed on the web is LATENCY

👉 Latency is the TIME DELAY between when a data packet is sent and when it's received (express in milliseconds) <br />
👉 EVERY Http Request to get the Response Will Have a LATENCY

## 👨🏻‍💻 We also have CPU and GPU problems
